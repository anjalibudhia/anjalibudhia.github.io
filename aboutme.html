    <h3> ABOUT </h3>
    <p> This is a gallery of images that I have taken during my travels over the years. I was born in Christchurch, surrounded by nature as shown in the bottom left picture. In 2019, I moved to Wellington to study design at Massey University to further my knowledge of art and design. <br><br> I discovered my love for travelling when we did our biggest trip in 2016. These places were around Europe and the United Kingdom. I found it interesting in trying different foods and seeing how their culture was so different from ours. My love for photography came at a young age as I was always playing around with my parents' camera trying to capture anything that I could. <br><br>Mixing travelling and photography has been a great experience and has helped me save memories from my travels that I can share.
